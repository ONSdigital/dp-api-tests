dp-api-tests
================

### Getting started

These tests should be run against empty databases. To ensure this, your applications should be configured to use a different database.
Do this by running the following and then restarting your applications:
```
export MONGODB_DATABASE=test
export MONGODB_IMPORTS_DATABASE=test
```

`go test ./...` - run all the tests

### Testing standards

All tests should be written in the following structure:
* Teardown all data related to test
* Setup all data related to test, do NOT use API's to setup this data, if this fails then the test fails for the wrong reason.
* Run test
* Teardown all data related to test
