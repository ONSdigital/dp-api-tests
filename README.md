dp-api-tests
================

### Getting started

These tests should be run against empty databases. To ensure this, your
applications should be configured to use a different database.
Do this by running the following and then restarting your applications:
```
export MONGODB_DATABASE=test
export MONGODB_FILTERS_DATABASE=test
export MONGODB_IMPORTS_DATABASE=test
```
or by running `make acceptance` instead of `make debug` to start up the
following services:
```
dp-dataset-api
dp-filter-api
dp-import-api
```

If you're running applications using websysd ensure `InheritEnvironment`
is set to true in the `websysd.json` file.

The acceptance tests are split between running in publishing or web and result
in different results/responses; by default you should be running the services in
publishing.

To test services in publishing run the following command:

`cd publishing; go test ./...`

To run the web tests, make sure all instances of your API services are running
in web and then run the following command:

`cd web; go test ./...`

### Testing standards

All tests should be written in the following structure:
* Teardown all data related to test
* Setup all data related to test, do NOT use API's to setup this data, if this fails then the test fails for the wrong reason.
* Run test
* Teardown all data related to test
